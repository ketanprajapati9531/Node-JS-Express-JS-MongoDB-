Collection validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily. 
Predefined Structure can be implemented on the collection. 
Constraints can be applied to documents of collections using Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and 
is used to translate 
between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database. It means you can store JSON documents 
in it, and the structure of these documents can vary as it is not enforced like SQL
databases. This is one of the advantages of using NoSQL as it speeds up application 
development and reduces the complexity of deployments.
