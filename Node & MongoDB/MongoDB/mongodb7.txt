Delete Operations
Delete operations operate on a single collection, like update and create operations.
Delete operations are also atomic for a single document. You can provide delete 
operations with filters and criteria in order to specify which documents you would 
like to delete from a collection. The filter options rely on the same syntax that
read operations utilize.

MongoDB has two different methods of deleting records from a collection:

db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()


deleteOne()
deleteOne() is used to remove a document from a specified collection on the MongoDB 
server. A filter criteria is used to specify the item to delete. It deletes the first
record that matches the provided filter.

db.RecordsDB.deleteOne({name:"Maki"})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years", "species" : "Cat", "ownerAddress" : "521 E. Cortland", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993a2ce6e8850d88270b7"), "name" : "Marsh", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "451 W. Coffee St. A204", "chipped" : true }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd993f3ce6e8850d88270b8"), "name" : "Loo", "age" : "5", "species" : "Dog", "ownerAddress" : "380 W. Fir Ave", "chipped" : true }



deleteMany()
deleteMany() is a method used to delete multiple documents from a desired collection with
 a single delete operation. A list is passed into the method and the individual items are 
 defined with filter criteria as in deleteOne().

db.RecordsDB.deleteMany({species:"Dog"})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 2 }
> db.RecordsDB.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5fd98ea9ce6e8850d88270b5"), "name" : "Kitana", "age" : "4 years",
 "species" : "Cat"}
