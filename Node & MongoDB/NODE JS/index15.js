/*
An Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE for friends) is a way to execute
 functions immediately, as soon as they are created.

IIFEs are very useful because they donâ€™t pollute the global object, and they are a
 simple way to isolate variables declarations.

This is the syntax that defines an IIFE:

(function() {
   //code
})()

IIFEs can be defined with arrow functions as well:

(() => {
    //code
})()
We basically have a function defined inside parentheses, and then we append () to 
execute that function: ( function )().


(function(){
    var a = "ketan";
console.log(a);
})
