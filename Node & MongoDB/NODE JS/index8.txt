Diff between Asynchronous and Synchronous program in node js

1. Synchronous methods: Synchronous functions block the execution of the program until 
the file operation is performed.

These functions are also called blocking functions. 

The synchronous methods have File Descriptor as the last argument. File Descriptor is 
a reference to opened files.

It is a number or a reference id to the file returned 
after opening the file using fs.open() method of the fs module. All asynchronous methods
can perform synchronously just by appending “Sync” to the function name. Some of the 
synchronous methods of fs module in NodeJS are:

fs.readFileSync()
fs.renameSync()
fs.writeSync()
fs.writeFileSync()
fs.fsyncSync()
fs.appendFileSync()
fs.statSync()
fs.readdirSync()
fs.existsSync()

2. Asynchronous methods:

 Asynchronous functions do not block the execution of the program and each command is
 executed after the previous command even if the previous command has not computed 
 the result. 
 The previous command runs in the background and loads the result once 
 it has finished processing. Thus, these functions are called non-blocking functions. 
 They take a callback function as the last parameter. Asynchronous functions are 
 generally preferred over synchronous functions as they do not block the execution
  of the program whereas synchronous functions block the execution of the program 
  until it has finished processing. Some of the asynchronous methods of fs module 
  in NodeJS are:

fs.readFile()
fs.rename()
fs.write()
fs.writeFile()
fs.fsync()
fs.appendFile()
fs.stat()
fs.readdir()
fs.exists()
